# Final Project Dashboard

This project explores disparities in HPV vaccination uptake among U.S. adolescents using provider-reported data from the CDC's 2023 National Immunization Survey - Teen (NIS-Teen).

###  Research Focus

The dashboard visualizes HPV vaccine uptake by:
- **Race/Ethnicity**
- **Maternal Education**
- **U.S. Census Region**

Two interactive widgets are included:
1. **Bar Chart** — Visualizes vaccine uptake by maternal education for a selected region and racial group.
2. **Choropleth Map** — Shows HPV uptake across states grouped by region, with toggle options by race.

Built using `flexdashboard`, `plotly`, and `survey` in R.
